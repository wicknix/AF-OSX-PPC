The source from this directory was copied from the skia subversion trunk
using the update.sh script. The changes made were those applied by update.sh,
the addition/update of Makefile.in files for the Mozilla build system.

This is an import of Skia from 2014-07-28 (b1ab5fdd11bb358d738c1bfa63737dc65174a281)

To update to a new version of Skia:

- Copy the entire trunk/ directory from a Skia clone to mozilla-central/gfx/skia
- cd gfx/skia && ./gyp_mozbuild

Once that's done, use git status to view the files that have changed. Keep an eye on GrUserConfig.h
and SkUserConfig.h as those probably don't want to be overwritten by upstream versions.

This process will be made more automatic in the future.
